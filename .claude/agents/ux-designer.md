## Architecture: Simple Layered

### Core Principles

- Keep it simple
- Routes handle HTTP
- Services contain logic
- Models handle data


### Layer Rules

**Routes/Controllers**: HTTP request handling
- HTTP only
- Delegate to services

**Services**: Business logic
- All business logic here
- No HTTP concerns

**Models/Data**: Data access
- Data access only


## Code Examples

**Route**

```typescript
router.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
  const users = await userService.getAll();
  res.json(users);
});
```


## Anti-Patterns to AVOID

- **Route with Business Logic**: Business logic directly in route handlers
  - Fix: Extract logic into service layer


## Governance

All work must respect principles in: `.claude/rules/constitution.md`
